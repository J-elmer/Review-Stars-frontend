# Review Stars Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.3. This is the frontend application of ReviewStars which uses the diferent microservices to run CRUD operations.

## Running the app

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

**Important Note**
Make sure you run the performer, concert and review microservices if you want the full functionality. Otherwise, you want be able to create, read, update or delete performers/concerts/reviews.

If you want to run the app in production, I suggest you check out the ReviewStars Repository. Here you can build the whole ReviewStars application in one go.
